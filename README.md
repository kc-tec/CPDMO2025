| Name of activity	 |  **Effective Pedagogy for Teachers** Description: In this course, participants will acquire a very practical understanding of how the brain develops through early childhood, and of the mechanisms for remembering information. The participants will use this knowledge to better understand and practice specific teaching methods related to group management, questioning techniques, and formative assessment. During the course, participants will receive ongoing feedback to help them improve their teaching in specific areas that they have identified as having potential to enhance student learning outcomes. To facilitate this, participants will use these teaching techniques directly in their own classrooms. |  |
| Main objectives | Participants gain a clear understanding of the role, desirable traits, and expected skills of teachers, as well as how Teacher Professional Standards contribute to planning teachers' skill development. They understand the current thinking on Learning Styles and Teaching Styles, and acquire the ability to identify different preferred learning styles within any given class of students. Teachers will also gain an understanding of their own learning preferences and consider how they influence their own teaching. Reflect on their own teaching practice and set their own targets for improvement after receiving guided, constructive feedback from a partnering colleague Developed their own observation and feedback skills by observing and working in partnership with a colleague. Acquire a comprehensive understanding of fundamental teaching methods, including formative assessment, questioning techniques for knowledge reinforcement, group management, and lesson objective formulation aligned with Bloom’s Taxonomy levels.  |  |
| Targeted participants | **In-service primary school teachers interested on improving the teaching skills.** |  |
| Criteria to select participants | **Any type of teacher (including contract teachers) teaching at a public Cambodian primary school.** |  |
| Expected outputs/outcomes | After completing the course, participating teachers are expected to have: Acquired a clear understanding of the role, desirable characteristics, and expected abilities of teachers, as well as the role that Teacher Professional Standards play in the planning of skill development for teachers. Developed a better understanding of child development, how the brain works, and how these affect education and lead to different learning styles and preferences. Gained a homogeneous and deeper understanding of the educational value of the techniques reviewed and practiced during the course, and in particular of formative assessment, questioning, and grouping, along with an analysis of how to avoid stereotypes.  Practiced the application of these techniques in lesson plans using Bloom’s taxonomy to measure the effort and level of analysis required from their students. Developed their own observation and feedback skills by observing and working in partnership with a colleague.  Learned to work with other teachers to support each other’s development of teaching skills through peer observation.  |  |

Access to the online course in the CDP platform is provided by using the access credentials provided.  Unit 1.1 and 2.1 help participants reflect on their role as teachers. Participants look in detail at how reaching the standards provide them with the necessary skills to improve their teaching.   Input and activities in Units 1.4 and 2.4 are specifically dedicated to learning styles.    Techniques used in lesson plans include formative assessment, grouping and questioning. **Formative Assessment** is taught in Units 1.5 and 2.5, **Grouping** in 3.3 and 4.3, and **Questioning** in Units 3.5 and 4.5. An example of requiring writing of a lesson plan is Unit 4.4.  Practicing the Bloom Taxonomy objective levels for Lesson Plans is done in Units 3.4 and 4.4. As an example, grouping techniques, studied in detail in Units 3.3 and 4.3, are an example of techniques that – if used correctly –facilitate student learning. Teaching styles are analyzed in Unit 1.4 and 2.4, including the completion of a VARK (teaching styles) questionnaire. The VARK questionnaire is part of the handouts. The partnership cycle is explained in Unit 1.6), partnerships are created in Unit 1.6 and teaching/ observation/target cycles are done in Units 2.6 and 4.6. As a result of teaching a class observed by a colleague Unit 2.6, teachers analyze the observation and establish personal improvement targets that they will try to attain in the observed lesson that they will teach in Unit 4.6.    Units 1.1 and 2.1 that require teachers to clearly identify their roles as models for students.   |
| Which specific standard(s) is/are addressed (e.g. 1.4 Understand how to prepare a lesson plan, 2.3 Employ a variety of appropriate ways for assessing student learning, etc.)? Please consult the Teacher Professional Standards (2016) and indicate all which apply.   | 1.3 Be aware of national educational policies, national education goals and purposes of general education 1.8 Understand how students learn. 1.9 Understand differences in student skills, learning speed and learning styles. 2.1 Prepare correct and effective lesson plans, teaching curriculum and assessment of learning outcomes 2.3 Employ a variety of appropriate ways for assessing student learning 2.9 Use a range of teaching methods to facilitate student learning and to meet MoEYS Curriculum Standards. 2.10 Meet student learning styles and needs through suitable implementation of various teaching methods  3.1 Regularly evaluate own teaching and make a plan for personal professional development. 3.5 Interact with other teachers in professional learning activities. 4.2 Demonstrate commitment and responsibility to the teaching profession. |  |
| How will the CPD offering help teachers to meet the specific standards? (Please continue response overleaf or on an additional page as needed).  | ***1.3 Be aware of national educational policies, national education goals and purposes of general education.*** In order to better understand the role of the teachers, the course reviews why standards are valuable. Teachers are required to reflect on some of the standards and to explain what teachers who reach the standard are able to do to improve the education of their students. ***1.8 Understand how students learn.** and **1.9 Understand differences in student skills, learning speed and learning styles.*** The course reviews how the brain works, learning mechanisms and the different theories on learning styles, requiring teachers to reflect on them, use a questionnaire to understand their own learning style, and practice doing materials and methods that are valuable to students with different learning styles. ***2.1 Prepare correct and effective lesson plans, teaching curriculum and assessment of learning outcomes.** and **2.3 Employ a variety of appropriate ways for assessing student learning.*** The course includes a good number of pedagogical techniques that are used as part of lesson plans. Along the course, teachers must integrate and implement these techniques correctly in lesson plans that they will have to teach, including constant use of formative assessment. Formative and Summative assessment techniques are taught as part of the different methods. Formative Assessment is repeatedly applied along the course. The course also includes wide practice of the use of Bloom’s Taxonomy, as a tool to improve and clarify the level of thinking that a lesson plan will require from the students.  ***2.9 Use a range of teaching methods to facilitate student learning and to meet MoEYS Curriculum Standards.** and **2.10 Meet student learning styles and needs through suitable implementation of various teaching methods*****.**  A core objective of the course is the learning of activity-based and question-based teaching methods that facilitate student learning, while acquiring habits for constantly improving the teacher’s skills through observation and feedback. Teachers are required to apply the techniques inclusively, responding to different types of learning styles. The course itself is strongly activity-based, with most learning taking place through activities and reflection. ***3.1 Regularly evaluate own teaching and make a plan for personal professional development.** and **3.5 Interact with other teachers in professional learning activities.*** Early in the course, teachers learn how to work with a partner to develop a system for professional development and improvement of their teaching. This system, based on mutual observation and mutual respect, is practiced over and over along the course, applied to all the techniques that are learned. Through the feedback, teachers are able to evaluate their own teaching and reflect on what can be improved, providing new targets for improvement. ***4.2 Demonstrate commitment and responsibility to the teaching profession.*** From the very beginning of the course, teachers are required to reflect on the characteristics of a good teacher, with an emphasis on how to become role models for their trainees. Along the course, the aim of improving teaching techniques is not only to provide better training to their trainees, but also to assume and demonstrate their commitment by becoming role models that trainees will want to follow.  |  |

It could also be directly used in in other platform that uses Moodle as a base. Please give details:  | **Please attach the references**  The course can be visited using the credential listed at the end of this document. |
| Are the trainers leading the implementation of the CPD activity capable and ready  to use this system/platform? | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: Kampong Cham PTTC teacher educators have received Training of Trainers on how to teach the course. The course is also very similar to a course for teacher educators that they have received in 2021 and 2022, and they are familiar with the pedagogical and observation techniques used in the course.  | **Please attach the reference of trainers’ qualification** See the ToT Workshop agenda in the online folder with all materials. |
| **Benchmarks: Content addressed** |  | **Evidence/documents to be submitted** |
| Which specialized subjects or education‐related expertise (content, pedagogy, education psychology, etc.) does the CPD offering offer? (Please continue response overleaf or on an additional page as needed). | Pedagogy. The course has been specifically developed to fill the gaps on pedagogical knowledge and practice detected by a Training Needs Assessment done by UNESCO in 2019\.    The course covers a revision of basic concepts of Pedagogy, and develops a CPD methodology based on peer-observation and support. It includes the practice of the CPD methodology. It covers activity-based learning, concentrating on three specific aspects of it: grouping, questioning, and formative assessment. | The course is specifically on the Fundaments of Effective Pedagogy for teachers, as described in the Syllabus document. |
| Does the CPD offering include a strong focus on applying theory to practice and reflection on professional teaching practice? Please explain how the CPD offering supports participants in applying theory to practice and in reflecting on their professional teaching practice. (Please continue response overleaf or on an additional page as needed). | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: The teaching methodology used in the course is activity-based learning. All through the course participants are required to discuss and reflect on the topics that they learn. They are also required to reflect on their own role as teachers. The Course provides input and practice on Pedagogy topics, but its strongest focus is on helping participants learn to use and practice a peer-observation-based CPD methodology, providing ample opportunities to reflect on their practice. Under this methodology, participants go through several cycles of teaching a class at their school while being observed by a colleague, then discussing with the observer to understand if they have reached their targets for the class, and – based on that \- develop new targets for improvement during the following class that will be observed.  | Regarding reflection: Units 1.1 and 2.1 shows an example of typical reflection activities included in the course. In these units teachers are required to reflect on their own role as educators. Regarding application of theory to practice: Unit 1.6 describes the Partnership approach that is used in the course, in which participants must apply the learning to their own classes, receive feedback from an observing colleague, and use this feedback to set further targets for improvement of their teaching. Partnerships are created in Unit 1.6, and classes are observed and targets are established in Units 2.6 and 4.6.   |
| Does the CPD offering include knowledge and understanding (both Specific content knowledge, *knowing that* and Application knowledge, *knowing how*)? If so, please give examples of how both types of knowledge are included. (Please continue response overleaf or on an additional page as needed). | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: The course provides specific “knowing that” content knowledge on a number of topics: Roles and Characteristics of Good Teacher. Teacher Professional Standards. Teaching styles. Learning Styles Child Development, the brain, learning mechanisms, teaching strategies in preschool. Activity-based learning. Formative Assessment  Grouping. Questioning-based teaching methods. Inquiry-based learning Concept-based learning. The course facilitates the understanding of this content through activity-based groupwork that ensures reflection and sharing about each piece of content. The “know how” part of the course includes learning how to use a methodology for continuous professional development based on partnerships between two teachers. The partnership methodology requires learning the mechanics of the partnership, preparing observation, effective and focused observation, debriefing after observation in an objective and non-judgmental way, defining targets for improvement and defining the focus of future observation. During the course, this technique is applied to actual classes taught by the teachers at their schools, which are observed by their colleague partner, who will later provide the right type of feedback for improvement.  | Examples of content knowledge would be the learning on Teaching styles in Unit 1.4, or the difference between Formative and Summative Assessment in Unit 1.5. An example of Application knowledge would be the development of lesson plans that apply specific child-centered techniques in Unit 4.2   The application of the methodology for continuous professional development is introduced in Unit 1.6, and classes are observed and targets are established in Units 2.6 and 4.6.  |
| Does the CPD offering include an activity promoting research **skills?** **[^1]** If so, please give brief details. | □ Yes ✔ No Please give details:  | An extract from the CPD offering which illustrates this response. |
| If so, does the research component include clear guidelines about intellectual property, how to cite sources, how to evaluate the quality of sources, and how to avoid plagiarism? Please give brief details. | □ Yes □ No Please give details: | An extract from the CPD offering which illustrates this response. |

| Benchmarks: Skills addressed |  | Evidence/documents to be submitted |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Please indicate which skills the CPD offering and associated assessment package is designed to help teachers to develop.   | *Transferable skills:  Improving own learning and performance.*  Through the peer-based CPD approach used in the course, teachers learn the skill of effective observation of other teachers, as well as the skill of listening carefully and learning about their own teaching through be the feedback of observation by others, focusing on specific aspects of their teaching and progressively improving their methods to provide better educational results in the future. Understanding of and the ability to apply teaching practice for individual student learning styles and needs The course gives an overview of the different available modern theories on student learning styles. This knowledge helps teachers reflect on these styles and on how teaching can be adapted to ensure that all students receive input that is well adapted to their needs by integrating in the class materials and methods that cater to the major learning styles (auditive, visual, kinetic).   Ability to plan for and manage student learning and classroom routines to ensure effective and enjoyable teaching and learning. Planning and managing student learning to ensure effective and enjoyable teaching and learning are the core objective of the course. The course’s content and practice attempt to have teachers acquire the habit of applying activity-based and inquiry-based learning for their trainees in all their lesson plans, increasing student implication and attention to the lesson, and improving their learning by discovering by themselves or practising the learning content by developing activity-based or inquiry-based lesson plans. For these lesson plans, the course analyses components such as formative assessment, grouping techniques or questioning techniques. Along the course participants analyse lesson plans presented to them and create their own lesson plans using the course’s learning.   Ability to collect, analyse, and interpret student                 learning assessment in order to improve teaching and learning practices  The bases of formative and summative assessment are formally taught, compared and practiced in one of the units of the course. Formative assessment is then revisited all along the course. Each lesson plan produced by the teacher that is part of the course is expected to seamlessly integrate formative assessment, turning it into a habit by the end of the course.  | The basic learning of the peer-based Approach takes place in Unit 1.6. and practice takes place in Units 2.6 and 4\. Learning styles are the focus of Units 1.4 and 2.4.   Several Units in the course provide elements that will need to be taken in to account in lesson plans (such as **learning styles** in Unit 1.4), or techniques that will have to be included in the lesson plans (**Formative Assessment,** **Grouping,** **Questioning).** Other units require either the analysis of lesson plans (Unit 3.4, practicing the Bloom ‘s Taxonomy objective levels for Lesson Plans, such as in Unit 4.4. **Learning styles** in Units 1.4 and 2.4 **Grouping** in Units 3.3 and 4.3. **Formative Assessment** in Units 1.5 and 2.5. **Questioning** in Units 3.5 and 4.5. Formative Assessment is studied Unit 1.5, and then applied along the course, and specifically in Unit 2.5. |
| Please explain briefly how the CPD offering seeks to develop this/these skill(s). |   |  |
| **Assessment: N.B. CPD credits will only be awarded if providers submit to the CPDMO evidence that participants have fulfilled the requirements, for example in the form of attendance lists and lists of scores/results.** |  | **Evidence/documents to be submitted** |
| Please consult the section on assessment in the CPD Handbook or the CPD credit system. Does the CPD offering include a coherent system of assessment/assessment framework which conforms to the CPD credit system? | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: The course includes an Assessment Guide for each of the Modules (Annex 4\) that provides a general description of how Master Trainers should do the assessment of the learners, as well as detailed instructions on how each assignment should be graded. The Assessment Guides details all the assignments and assessable activities that take place along each module. For each one of them, the Guide specifies the type of summative assessment that should be done and the type of formative feedback that should be provided to students. The Guide attempts to ensure that assessment is objective and reliable by detailing the criteria for each single point to be given to participants. Along both the face-to-face and online parts of the course, learners are expected to write and submit a number of assignments, which sometimes are forms to be filled, but others they are their own conclusions of the activities they have gone through. In some cases, assignments include developing teaching and learning materials used to teach the content that is the object of the unit.  Summative assessment of the online parts is mostly based on the amount of effort that teachers have applied to each activity, and specially on demonstrating that they have reflected on and applied the learning of the course. Each module includes a final assignment in which the teachers reflect on and demonstrate what they have assimilated from the learning and the experience in the course. Feedback is provided to correct any misunderstanding that teachers might display through the assignments. Master Trainers are expected to provide sufficient feedback for the teachers to understand their misunderstanding and learn the correct interpretations of the materials. The course also includes a number of quizzes, normally provided immediately after input. The role of these quizzes is purely formative; they induce participants to reflect on the content that they have just seen or read (not just remember something that was in the video). The quizzes provide immediate and automatic feedback on incorrect answers.  The is graded directly through the CDP platform. Grades for quizzes are calculated and assigned automatically. Grades and feedback for assignments are provided directly through the platform, and grades for attendance and participation are entered in the platform by the facilitator. A 65% grade is considered as successful completion. This grade is only attained if trainees have produced output in reflection sessions and observed classes. All documents submitted by participants are kept inside the Moodle Course Management System, and a backup is made at the end of the course. |  The Assessment Guide for each module (annex 4\) includes a table that details the specific points to be given for each assignment, the criteria for each point, and the required feedback if necessary. Each assignment is clearly defined in the Master Trainer Guide (for face-to-face activities) or in the online platform and the Participant Book. Each assignment is reflected in the Assessment Guide. Most of the assignments in the Assessment Guide require reflection or learning in order to give all the possible points for that assignment.  |
| Is 10-15% of the assessment of structured CPD activities based on attendance and punctuality? | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: 10% of the grade is based on attendance and punctuality (and another 10% for participation).  |  It is expressed in the grading table of the Assessment Guides (Annex 4). |
| 15.Does this CPD activity include a comprehensive end-of-training evaluation for feedback from the participants and future improvement? | □ Yes ✔ No Please give details:  | **Please attach the references** |
| 16.Are assignments designed to involve a range of appropriate methods of assessment and allow opportunities for teachers to demonstrate a wide range of competencies, knowledge and understanding?   | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details:  Assignments use different methods of assessment, including submitting written reports on topics, reports on course activities, and development of teaching and learning materials.  |  An example of the conclusion and learning of a partnership cycle is in the forms in Units 2.6 and 4.6.  |
| 17.Are assignments designed to demonstrate the ability to include a combination of theoretical and practical activities? | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: Different assignments along the course demonstrate different aspects of learning. Some assignments show that participants have understood well the content, some demonstrate that they are able to apply it, and others demonstrate that participants are correctly interiorizing and applying the methodology for improving their own teaching practice.  | Creating teaching and learning lesson plans demonstrate that participants have correctly understood the theoretical knowledge, as in the case of the assignment in Unit 4.4. The assignments for Units 2.6 and 4.6 are an example of demonstrating the ability to apply are the reports after each partnership observation cycle. |
| 18.Are assignments designed to demonstrate both output and outcome? | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: The assessment methodology for the course relies entirely on assignments, and not on exams as such. Participants are expected to produce a number of documents that elaborate on their understanding of what they have learned. The assignments must demonstrate that they have learned the content, but also that they have reflected on it. Some of the assignments are forms that provide information on how the methodology learnt in the course has been applied to specific classes taught by a participant at their school, and observed by another participant (or vice versa), demonstrating that they have learnt the methodology, learnt about their own teaching, and made an attempt to improve it.  |   An example of demonstration of output are the notes that participants are requested to write during the reflection activities, as in the case of the assignment in Unit 2.1. An example of demonstrating outcome are the reports after each partnership observation cycle, as in Units 2.6 and 4.6.   |
| 19.Do assignments include a focus on the teacher’s demonstration of **outputs** (for example: reflection paper, written reports, oral or video presentations, curriculum or pedagogical materials, accompanied by an introduction presenting the underpinning theoretical framework, portfolio of varied outputs, action research reports for a PLC sharing session) in the following four areas:  | Knowledge and understanding  ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: Application of key principles to related contexts  ✔ Yes □ No Please give details:  Ability to reflect on salient issues  ✔ Yes □ No Please give details: The course advances by following for most topics a scheme of providing **knowledge**, followed by assessing **output**, **reflecting on** the knowledge, and **applying** it, each step demonstrated by assignments. An example would be how Formative assessment is treated in the course. Following **self-input**, participants are assessed for knowledge acquisition and understanding by having to describe in an assignment how formative assessment is used in demonstration lessons that they have seen. Participants then progress to a **reflection stage** in which they look into their own teaching, and determine if they are using formative assessment correctly, writing notes on their thoughts. Then, for the final stage, they **apply** what they have learnt to the preparation of a class observation sheet that specifically facilitates observation of formative assessment in a class. To be able to do this, they must have very clearly understood what they need to focus on in order to understand if formative assessment is being used correctly, a higher level of understanding (when doing this assignment, they are applying levels 5 and 6 of Bloom’s Taxonomy: evaluation and creation). Transferable skills ✔ Yes □ No Please give details:  The most valuable transferable skill from the course is the development of non-judgmental observation skills, and the acceptance of peer observation as a tool for continuous improvement of the participant’s professional skills. Through being repeatedly observed, teachers gain security on their own teaching, and do not mind being observed, while gaining a better understanding of their teaching. This skill automatically transfers to effective observation of trainees and in-service teachers.  The skill is assessed through assignments that require a specific reporting format, in which participants report and reflect on the experience of each cycle, demonstrating their advancement at each stage.  |  This is seen in the assignment of Unit 4.4. The observation cycle (Preparation, observation, debriefing, setting targets) is performed right time along the course (4 as teacher and 4 as observer) in Units 2.6 and 4.6. Each of these lessons ends with an assignment (with a specific format) in which they report and reflect on the cycle, reflecting their increasing understanding and ability. |
| 20.Do assignments include a focus on a teacher’s demonstration of **outcomes**: that they have applied knowledge and understanding acquired through engaging in the CPD opportunity to their teaching work to attempt to produce positive change in their professional activity? | ✔ Yes □ No Please give details:  As part of the course, participants are required to include in their own teaching the new techniques that they learn, to have a colleague observe their class and report to them if they have reached their goals in the class. Based on this information they set up new goals for the next class, and report on what they have gained and what they have accomplished, as well as they new (higher) goals. The assignment for each of these lessons is to report on what has occurred during the cycle, showing the actual outcome that the course has for the participant.  |  An example would be in Units 2.6 and 4.6. |
